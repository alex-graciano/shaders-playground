# Shader playground

GLSL shader playground. Repository aimed to test simple GLSL ideas (mainly for fragment shaders). This contains the most straightforward skeleton to execute GLSL using the WebGL library [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The web app is being bundled in a minimal [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) server.

It uses the simple [Tweakpane](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/) lib to link parameters to be tested in the sketch in a straightforward way.

### Execution
```
> npm install # will install the node dependencias (just express)
> npm run start # will start the application listening to the 8080 port
```
